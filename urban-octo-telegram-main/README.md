# Code Refactor Starter Code
Submitting my first refactor code
I highlighted areas and highlighted changes made with comments in both HTML and CSS
I left certain alt images "" because they don't have much to describe other than being placeholders
I organized CSS into sequential order, going from header to content to benefits to footer and ensuring all elements and classes and sizing relating to each section was contained in each section
